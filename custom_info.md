# User Guide: vCon Admin Interface

## Introduction
Welcome to the user guide for the vCon Admin Interface. This interface is designed to help you manage vCon servers and their associated virtual conversations. In this guide, we will walk you through each page of the interface and explain what it does.

## Export Page
The export page allows you to export vCons from the vCon server. You can select specific vCons or choose to export all vCons. The exported vCons can be saved as files in a specified format, such as CSV or JSON. This feature is useful for backing up vCons or transferring them to another system.


## Import Page
The import page enables you to import vCons into the vCon server. You can upload vCon files in supported formats, such as CSV or JSON, and the system will process and store them as virtual conversations. This feature is useful for adding new vCons or updating existing ones from external sources.

## Info Page
The info page tells you about the quality of vCons in your local store.

## Inspection Page
The inspection page allows you to view detailed information about a specific vCon. You can search for a vCon by its identifier or other criteria and access its recordings, analysis results, and attachments. This page provides a comprehensive overview of a vCon's content and metadata, making it easy to review and analyze specific vCons.

## Workbench Page
The workbench page is designed for using vCons with an LLM (Language and Linguistics Model). It provides a collaborative environment where you can apply various linguistic analysis techniques to vCons. You can perform tasks such as sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and entity extraction using the LLM's capabilities. This page is ideal for researchers or analysts who want to extract insights from vCons using advanced linguistic models.
